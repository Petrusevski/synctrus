  <h1>Burn Rules &amp; Perceived Value</h1>
  <p>Reward programs succeed when members not only earn but also <strong>redeem</strong>. Redemption is the moment of emotional payoff — it closes the loop and reinforces engagement. The structure of your burn rules determines how valuable and attainable the program feels.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>1. Point Value Ladders</h2>
  <p>A <strong>point value ladder</strong> defines how many points are required to unlock rewards of different value tiers. It creates a sense of progress and aspiration.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Flat ladder:</strong> Every point has a consistent cash equivalent (e.g., 100 points = €1). Easy to communicate, but less excitement.</li>
    <li><strong>Tiered ladder:</strong> Higher-value rewards have slightly better exchange rates (e.g., 500 points = €6). Encourages saving and long-term engagement.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic ladder:</strong> Point value adjusts by category or season (e.g., 20% more value on travel or eco-products).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Example: <em>Airline programs</em> often use tiered ladders — saving miles for business-class upgrades gives a higher value per mile than small gift cards, reinforcing aspiration.</p>

  <h2>2. Dynamic Catalogs</h2>
  <p>Modern programs increasingly use dynamic catalogs — digital reward stores that adapt inventory and pricing to context.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Seasonal:</strong> Add themed rewards around holidays, sports events, or brand campaigns.</li>
    <li><strong>Personalized:</strong> Use member data to surface relevant rewards (e.g., show “Coffee voucher” to daily café spenders).</li>
    <li><strong>Inventory-based:</strong> Sync redemption options with current stock or partner availability.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Dynamic catalogs prevent fatigue, add freshness, and create repeat visits to the redemption interface — an underutilized engagement surface.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>3. Instant vs. Delayed Gratification</h2>
  <p>How quickly members can enjoy the value they’ve earned affects loyalty psychology. There are two dominant redemption modes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Instant gratification:</strong> e.g., “€5 off this purchase now.” Ideal for mass retail, fast-moving goods, and younger demographics.</li>
    <li><strong>Delayed gratification:</strong> e.g., “Save 10,000 points for a flight upgrade.” Works for premium brands, travel, and long-term aspirational value.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Effective programs blend both — small instant wins to sustain engagement, and big aspirational goals to drive retention.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>4. Anchoring Redemptions</h2>
  <p><strong>Anchoring</strong> uses price psychology to shape perceived value. By setting reference points for redemptions, brands influence how valuable points feel.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Display “was 6000 pts, now 5000 pts” to frame savings.</li>
    <li>Offer “featured rewards” at slightly better rates to encourage redemption without increasing cost.</li>
    <li>Show equivalent cash value alongside points (“This costs 2500 pts ≈ €5”) to reinforce transparency.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Anchoring keeps members engaged by making redemptions feel strategic and rewarding, even when real value remains stable.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>5. Balancing Value &amp; Cost</h2>
  <p>Every point has a cost to the business. Setting and maintaining perceived value requires financial modeling and behavioral insight.</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Dimension</th>
        <th>Business View</th>
        <th>Member View</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Point Cost</td>
        <td>Typically 0.5–1.0% of spend</td>
        <td>“Feels like real money” if redemption is smooth</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Breakage</td>
        <td>Improves margin, but too high = disengagement</td>
        <td>“My points never expire or vanish” feels safe</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Redemption Rate</td>
        <td>Goal: 40–60% active redemption</td>
        <td>“I can actually use my rewards!”</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Balance clarity, accessibility, and financial control — perceived value is built not by generosity, but by predictability and fairness.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>6. Real-Life Example</h2>
  <p><strong>Starbucks Rewards</strong> nails instant gratification with “free drink” redemptions starting at low thresholds — attainable after just a few visits. Meanwhile, <strong>Delta SkyMiles</strong> uses aspirational delayed gratification through upgrades and free flights. Both succeed because members feel <em>agency</em> over how and when to redeem.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>7. Takeaway</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Define a clear, consistent point value model.</li>
    <li>Use dynamic catalogs to keep redemptions fresh.</li>
    <li>Balance instant and aspirational rewards to maintain both excitement and commitment.</li>
    <li>Anchor perceived value through smart presentation, not inflated generosity.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In loyalty, <em>earning builds intent — but redemption builds emotion</em>. The burn experience is where loyalty becomes real.</p>
